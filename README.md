# Adventure Game 🏰

A Python-based implementation of the classic text-based Adventure game (Colossal Cave Adventure). This program parses natural language commands to navigate through rooms, interact with objects, and solve puzzles.

## 🎮 How to Play
The game runs in the terminal. You navigate the world by typing commands like `NORTH`, `WEST`, `TAKE LAMP`, or `INVENTORY`.

### Prerequisites

* The `Crowther` or 'Small' data files (must be in the same directory). This is a data-driven program (parses text files in the same directory). 

### Running the Game

2. Navigate to the folder.
3. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python Adventure.py
